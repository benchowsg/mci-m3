![Empowering And Mentoring Our Youths](/images/focus-area-empowering.jpg)

Our youth play a key part in the future of Singapore and our Malay/Muslim community. We support our youth and develop their strengths and capabilities through empowerment programmes that are also aimed at opening up opportunities for them to embark on various education and career pathways.

Mentoring is also an important component of youth development. Connecting youths with mentors and role-models in the community, while bridging them to resources, schemes and training programmes, helps guide and inspire them to realise their potential.

All our empowerment programmes are anchored on a mentoring-centric model, where the youth can interact and learn from mentors and young professionals. Through this, we aim to develop a vibrant Malay/Muslim youth core, inspiring each youth to continue to pay it forward and give back to the community.

### **Empowerment Programmes**

Our youth have access to a selection of gender-specific mentoring programmes:

* Pathfinders, caters to male students, helping them develop their capabilities through proactive mentoring, and by providing insights to National Service. Led by Malay/Muslim volunteers from the Singapore Armed Forces, Pathfinders is offered at the various M<sup>3</sup>@Town.

* Empowerment Programmes for Boys (EPB) and Empowerment Programme for Girls (EPG?) are gender-specific programmes with pilots offered at the Institutes of Technical Education (ITE) Youth Spaces.

* The national level Empowerment Programme for Youths programme focusses on engaging the general Malay/Muslim youth through civic participation of community and national-level activities. Look out for it at M<sup>3</sup>@Towns.
