Strong families are the foundation of strong communities.
Headed by Associate Professor Muhammad Faisal Ibrahim, this focus area aims to provide a continuum of care and support for Malay and
Muslim couples and their families in the areas of marriage, parenting and early childhood development.

### **Available Resources**

The following community resources are available for couples and families in the various M<sup>3</sup>@Towns:

**KelasMateMatika@CC**
*Building confidence in numeracy skills for pre-schoolers and their parents*

This 10-week educational programme, launched in September 2018, has already benefited over 300 parents and children. In
2019, M<sup>3</sup> aims to reach out to give times the number of beneficiaries through collaboration with community centres islandwide.

**Pre-school Outreach**
*Championing the importance of pre-school education*

Driven by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), this programme leverages six outreach agencies including
Yayasan MENDAKI to promote the importance of pre-school education to low-income families with children aged 3 years and
above. Through home visits, MENDAKI helps families to enrol their children in pre-school and works with them to ensure regular
attendance.

**Bersamamu**
*Supporting Muslim couples from before marriage to throughout their marriage journeys*

To inspire strong and stable Muslim marriages, this ground-up initiative by Naib Kadi supports couples in their journey from
before the big day and through the rest of their lives together. Couples begin their pre-marriage journey with a consultation with
their selected Naib Kadi (marriage solemniser) prior to their solemnisation ceremony.

**Marital First Responder Training**
*Training volunteer marriage counsellors*

This initiative by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) aims to equip a community of volunteers with the skills to
provide basic marriage advisory, enabling them to assist married couples in need. Piloted at M3@Nee Soon in March 2019, this
initiative is made possible with support from local Malay Activity Executive Committees (MAECs), mosques, MENDAKI and
MSF.
