MUIS has been supporting Prisons Incare Religious Services (PICRS) through the Muslim Counselling Services SANA (MCS-SANA) since 1979. The service deploys religious counsellors for Jumaah prayers as well as religious sessions with prison inmates. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Singapore Prisons Service (SPS) have since collaborated with MUIS to strengthen incare services through the FITRAH <u>(Family and In-mates Throughcare Assistance Haven)</u> programme.

FITRAH provides enhanced support services to Muslim incarcerated individuals and ex-offenders, and their families. Established in November 2018, FITRAH looks to improve current incare services and in the long run, provide after-care services, with a view to facilitating the successful rehabilitation of ex-offenders and their eventual reintegration with society.

FITRAH also aims to increase the numbers of volunteers (religious counsellors and befrienders) who can deliver its programmes as well as improve the quality of programmes and services for both incare and after-care.

### **Aftercare Services**

##### **Back-To-FITRAH package**
<p class="desc">*Meaningful gifts for life after prison*</p>

The day an ex-offender is released symbolises a new start in the individual’s life and the beginning of the journey to reintegrate with society. FITRAH’s new scheme, Back-To-FITRAH, seeks to be the first touch-point for ex-offenders upon their release. FITRAH officers and volunteers are deployed to receive these ex-offenders at the prison gate and give them a Back-To-FITRAH package which includes *fidyah<sup>[1]</sup>* voucher, an EZ-link card, a prayer mat and an information package on assistance available. Twenty-five ex-offenders have benefited from this initiative since its launch in April 2019.

##### **Community Befriending**
<p class="desc">*Connecting families to care and support*</p>

Rehabilitation is a challenging journey not only for ex-offenders. Many do not see the hardships faced by their family members. Community Befrienders is a FITRAH-developed group that reaches out to inmates’ families, connecting them to a network of social assistance. The group also conducts home visits to be attuned to the needs of the families and offer necessary information or connection to assistance. Mosques provide facilities for counselling and the training of volunteers in collaboration with the SPS as well as the Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) under the People’s Association and the Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MAEC). This added strong support from the community will give ex-offenders an even better chance to reintegrate successfully into society.

##### **Partnership with Mosques**
<p class="desc">*A system of holistic support*</p>

FITRAH also works with identified mosques to offer after-care services and programmes for ex-offenders and their families. It also helps refer the families to 31 mosques for zakat financial assistance. Here, the families can benefit from support programmes as well as Islamic Education programmes under aLIVE, ADIL and Home-based Islamic Learning.
