Our youths play a key part in the future of Singapore and our Malay/Muslim community. We support our youths and develop their strengths and capabilities through empowerment programmes that aim to open up opportunities for them to embark on various education and career pathways.

Mentoring is also an important component of youths development. Connecting youths with mentors and role-models in the community, while bridging them to resources, schemes and training programmes, helps guide and inspire them to realise their potential.

All our empowerment programmes are based on a mentoring-centric model, where the youths can interact and learn from mentors and young professionals. Through this, we aim to develop a vibrant Malay/Muslim youths core, inspiring each youth to continue to pay it forward and give back to the community.
