*17 June – 21 July 2019*

**#InspirasiSG** is a nationwide integrated marketing communications campaign led by M³ to amplify Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the
Environment and Water Resources and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs’ vision for a **Community of Success.**

![InspirasiSG Creative Visual](/images/inspirasi-graphic-v3.jpg)

This campaign seeks to showcase the Singapore Malay/Muslim Community as a Community of Success that is progressive yet rooted in its
traditions and identity, with a strong spirit of self-help and practises active citizenry as its way of life. It also aims to highlight the 3 “C”s (Character, Competency, Citizenry), mentioned in [Minister Masagos’ speech at the Annual Hari Raya Get-Together.](https://www.m3.sg/media-centre/speeches-and-press-releases/hari-raya-get-together-2019)

Through the 3 ”C”s – **Character** (strong values and morals), **Competency** (lifelong learning and skills upgrading) and **Citizenry** (active
community contribution), true success is redefined as one that is more values-based, highlighting the greater reward in making a difference to
other people’s lives. Similarly, the campaign tagline “Hidup berbakti, ikhlas berbudi” means to do good without expecting anything in return.

### **Who is your inspiration?**
*Contest Period: 17 June – 14 July 2019*

We all know of an inspiring story of someone who had succeeded against all odds and there are many amongst the Singapore Malay/Muslim
community (SMC) who we deem as an inspiration.

As part of the campaign, members of the SMC as well as the larger non-MM community, will be encouraged to submit real stories of
inspirational members from the Malay/Muslim community who have inspired them in one way or another, in all or any of the 3 “C”s.
