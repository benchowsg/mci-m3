A one-stop centre providing social, education, welfare, arts and media services, KURNIA stands for “Khidmat untuk
Rakyat: Nadi, Inspirasi dan Aspirasi” which translates to “Services for the community, pulse, inspiration and aspiration”.

KURNIA seeks to:
- serve community needs within a centralised and dedicated Malay-centric community space
- provide convenient access to assistance by co-locating the Malay Muslim Organisations (MMOs) and also by promoting
awareness of the readily available services that are provided by the MMOs. The participating agencies include AMP, BH,
CMAC, LBKM, MUHAMMADIYAH, PERGAS, TAA and 4PM.
