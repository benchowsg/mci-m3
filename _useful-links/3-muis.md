### Leading the community with the principles and traditions of Islam

Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), also known as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, was established as a
statutory body in 1968 when the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) came into effect. Under AMLA, MUIS plays an
advisory role to the President of Singapore on all matters relating to Islam in Singapore.

MUIS also ensures that the many and varied interests of Singaporeâ€™s Muslim community are looked after. It is
responsible for the promotion of religious, social, economic, education and cultural activities in accordance with the
principles and traditions of Islam as enshrined in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.
