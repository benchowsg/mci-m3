a. Wisma Geylang Serai

Wisma Geylang Serai (WGS) has been envisioned as the community, social, civic and cultural heart of the Geylang Serai
precinct. The WGS hub is a culturally distinctive and inclusive multi-agency development that celebrates the heritage of
Geylang Serai and all other local communities so as to encourage social interaction and community bonding across all
ages and races. It houses the Geylang Serai Community Club, South East Community Development Council, Geylang
Serai Heritage Gallery, KURNIA@WGS, arts houses as well as other social and community-related facilities.
        
b. Kurnia@WGS

A one-stop centre providing social, education, welfare, arts and media services, KURNIA stands for "Khidmat untuk Rakyat: Nadi,          Inspirasi dan Aspirasi" which translates to "Services for the community, pulse, inspiration and aspiration".

KURNIA seeks to:
- serve community needs within a centralised and dedicated Malay-centric community space
- provide convenient access to assistance by co-locating the Malay Muslim Organisations (MMOs) and also by promoting
awareness of the readily available services that are provided by the MMOs. The participating agencies include AMP, BH,
CMAC, LBKM, MUHAMMADIYAH, PERGAS, TAA and 4PM.
     

c. MUIS

*Leading the community with the principles and traditions of Islam*

Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS), also known as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, was established as a
statutory body in 1968 when the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) came into effect. Under AMLA, MUIS plays an
advisory role to the President of Singapore on all matters relating to Islam in Singapore.
MUIS also ensures that the many and varied interests of Singapore’s Muslim community are looked after. It is
responsible for the promotion of religious, social, economic, education and cultural activities in accordance with the
principles and traditions of Islam as enshrined in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.

d. MENDAKI

*Empowering Excellence Through Education*

Formed in 1982, Yayasan MENDAKI (Council for the Development of Singapore Malay/ Muslim Community) is dedicated
to empowering the community through excellence in education, in the context of a multi-racial and multi-religious
Singapore. MENDAKI programmes and services are streamlined into three key pillars — School-Ready, Perform in
School and Future Ready.

MENDAKI programmes are highly subsidised to enhance its accessibility to as many Muslim families as possible,
supplementing or complementing national initiatives. Programmes include the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme, Mentoring for
Youths and Parenting Workshops. MENDAKI also provides financial assistance schemes for education such as bursaries
and study loans.

e. MESRA

*Uniting the Community, Strengthening Cohesion*

The People’s Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (PA MESRA) was formed in 1988 as the
umbrella body of the Malay Activity Executive Committees (MAECs). The latter was formed in 1977 and to date, there
are 98 MAECs based in community clubs all over Singapore.

The main role of PA MESRA and the MAECs is to bring the Malay community together and integrate them into the larger
Singapore society so as to strengthen social cohesion and achieve One People, One Singapore.

Both PA MESRA and the MAECs are made up of volunteers. They are supported by staff from the People’s Association.

Some of the key initiatives by PA MESRA and the MAECs include Perkasa Warisan, Gentarasa, community dialogues,
SHIOK Series of courses and Health Fiesta.
