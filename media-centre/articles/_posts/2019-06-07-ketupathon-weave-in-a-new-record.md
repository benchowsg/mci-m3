Community, charity and collaboration - that is the essence behind every effort of M³. None of which could be better reflected than at Ketupathon 2019, held aptly at Wisma Geylang Serai on the 2nd of June 2019. Similar to its inception last year, members of the community contributed their time and skills for this year’s event, weaving ketupats side-by-side. Indeed, it was a sight for all to witness. And the best part? It is all for charity. 

True enough, a whopping total of 6,030 ketupat leaves were successfully weaved in a period of 12 hours, smashing last year’s record of 3,775 and cementing a new record in the SIngapore Book of Records. Echoing M³’s vision in rallying the community for the betterment of society, the event raised more than $45,000 for charities such as *Tabung Amal Aidilfitri (TAA)* and New Life Stories - including a $15,000 personal contribution by 11 Malay/Muslim MPs. 

Some of these MPs also came down to lend a helping hand, such as Minister of State for Manpower, Zaqy Mohamad and Jurong GRC MP Rahayu Mahzam. More notably, resident ‘ketupat expert’, who is also Mayor of South-East District and Senior Minister of State, Dr Maliki Osman, was present to officiate the event.

“Once again this year, we see how more members of the public, regardless of age or race, come together to weave ketupat leaves for the sake of charity”. He also praised the various groups of volunteers, most of whom were from Malay/Muslim organisations such as MUIS, Mendaki and the Singapore Silat Federation - all of whom joined forces to the achieve the goal in sight. 

Ketupathon 2019 reflected M³ as what it is; a collaborative effort that surpasses race, religion and culture. With a simple task at hand - to weave ketupat leaves for charity - the event brought about the *kampung spirit* that is too commonly found in the corners of Geylang Serai. 

With a new record and a generous amount collected for those in need, a celebration was at hand. The evening was greeted by film screenings, *wayang kulit* demonstrations, as well as  stellar musical performances by Jatt Ali, Junainah M Amin, Zubir Abdullah and Al-Jawaher. 

The amount raised will greatly assist TAA Trust Fund’s mission of helping the poor, needy, as well as the less fortunate. In addition, the New Life Stories represent a non-profit organisation that supports pre-school education for the children of incarcerated mothers, as well as providing much-needed support for mothers during their incarceration and reintegration back to society.
