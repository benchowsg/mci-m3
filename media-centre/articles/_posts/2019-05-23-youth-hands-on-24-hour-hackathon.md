For the fifth year running, a group of youths were put to the test and given the opportunity to pitch their creative ideas in a 24-hour hackathon in the Mosque Tech Challenge (MTC) 2019. 

Based on this year’s theme of ‘Healthy Living’, the MTC Hackathon allowed participants to compete individually or as a team to co-create solutions by leveraging technology to tackle health-related problems such as mental health issues. The teams were judged based on the relevancy, technical prowess and innovation of their proposed solutions. The judges were industry professionals.

The event was graced by Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, Member of Parliament (Jurong GRC), who highlighted that “this event supports the aspirations of youths (and at the same time) provides youths the opportunity to give back to society”.

“The MTC Hackathon is also an effort in line with M³’s aim to empower and guide youths,” added Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, who is also a member of the Board of Directors of Yayasan MENDAKI. 

Organised by MENDAKI Club, the event aims to impart the spirit of innovation by connecting to vulnerable youths through the aid of technology. It is hoped that programmes such as these will support and develop youths’ strengths and open up opportunities, allowing them to embark on various education and career pathways.
