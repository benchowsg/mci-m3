For the fifth year running, a group of youths were put to the test and given the opportunity to pitch their creative ideas in a 24-hour hackathon in the Mosque Tech Challenge (MTC) 2019. 

Based on this year’s theme of ‘Healthy Living’, the MTC Hackathon allowed participants to compete individually or as a team to hack all sorts of tech from mobile applications, website or hardware devices to tackle health-related problems such as health wearable and even delving into mental health issues. The teams were judged based on relevancy, technicality and innovation by invited industry professionals.

The event was also graced by Member of Parliament Jurong GRC, Mdm Rahayu Mahzam who shared that “this event supports the aspirations of youths” as well as “allowing youths the opportunity to give back to the community”.

“The MTC Hackathon is also an effort in line with M Kuasa Tiga (M³)’s aim to empower and guide youths,” added on the Board of Directors of Yayasan MENDAKI. 

Organised by MENDAKI Club, the event aims to impart the spirit of innovation by connecting youth with community issues through technology. As our youths play a key part in the future of our nation, programmes that support and develop their strengths would further open up opportunities, allowing them to embark on various education and career pathways.
