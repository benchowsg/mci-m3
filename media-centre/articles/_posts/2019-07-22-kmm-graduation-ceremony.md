It was a day of celebration for participants of KelasMateMatika@CC (KMM@CC), an initiative under M³. A graduation ceremony was held at Yishun Town Square, where participants and their families received their certificates from Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Social and Family Development and Education), Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.

Since its inception in September 2018, KMM@CC has assisted over 340 children to strengthen their basic numeracy skills, in preparation for primary school. The programme allows parents to gain skills in teaching approaches, such as the Mediated Learning Experience (MLE) technique – an interactional process between parent and child, which helps children respond better to stimuli.

The programme, which is targeted for families with children aged between four to six years old, also encourages family bonding through learn-and-play activities.

Held in conjunction with Playfest 2019 organised by Mendaki, the graduating class had the opportunity to take part in various fun-filled activities at the event, such as a magic show opening performance, electric bottle race and treasure hunt. These activities help to build the children’s cognitive, motor, science and literacy skills through fun and games. 

“In the past, my child was limited to only toys and educational videos. They are now more open to other activities. Sometimes when we are out, they will ask what is this and what is that. ‘Mum, this is green, Mum, this is red, Mum, what number is this?’ Thus, they are more creative,” said Mdm Puteri, who participated in this year’s KMM@CC with her child. 

As KMM@CC continues to expand its outreach, more parents of pre-schoolers will be able to receive support close to their homes. KMM@CC is available at the various M3@Towns, including in Admiralty, Woodlands, Marsiling, Keat Hong, Chua Chu Kang, Taman Jurong and Tampines.
