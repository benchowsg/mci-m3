While the month of Syawal may bring positivity to many, there are a group of families who may not be able to welcome Hari Raya festivities with similar emotions. However, thanks to a charitable event by MUIS - and in collaboration with its M³ partners, Mendaki and MESRA - the feeling of uncertainty is now diminished. 

Aptly named *Raikan Raya*, the event brought together 200 low-income families, where they received green packets from Senior Minister of State Dr Maliki Osman, as well as other representatives from MUIS. This joint-effort elevated the spirit of Ramadan, with the goal of providing comfort and reassurance of a festive Hari Raya for these families. 

However, the spirit of giving did not end there. The event, which falls under the *Sentuhan Ramadan* campaign, featured skills-upgrading programmes that catered to both young and old. These programmes encouraged not just interaction among beneficiaries, but also provided opportunities for growth among individuals, so as to secure a better future.

For example, one of these workshops involved financial planning, where parents were treated to useful tips such as financial literacy. There were also workshops meant for children and youths, equipping them with relevant communication skills needed to navigate their everyday surroundings. Thanks to these workshops by Yayasan MENDAKI - and through the efforts of *Projek Positif* and *Shiok MESRA* - these beneficiaries definitely did not leave empty-handed.

The event proved to be a success, and once again exemplifies M³ as a significant source of community-building and service delivery. Together, they leverage on each other’s strengths, without compromising their true goal of helping those that need it the most. Clearly explained by Dr Maliki, “MUIS extends its monetary support to fellow beneficiaries, while MENDAKI utilises their educational expertise to encourage childhood learning. MESRA, on the other hand, prepares neighbourhood courses that enable families to learn news skills”.

It truly is the power of the *kampung spirit.*
