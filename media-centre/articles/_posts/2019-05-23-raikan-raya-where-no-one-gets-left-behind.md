While the month of Syawal may bring positivity to many, there are some families who may not be able to experience Hari Raya festivities. This year, Muis in collaboration with its M³ partners, MENDAKI and MESRA, organised a charity event to spread the festive joy to vulnerable families in the lead up to Hari Raya.  

Aptly named *Raikan Raya (Celebrate Hari Raya)*, the specially invited 200 low-income families took part in the festivities, where they received green packets from Dr Maliki Osman, Senior Minister of State of Defence and Foreign Affairs. 

However, the spirit of giving does not end there. The event, which was held as part of MUIS’ *Sentuhan Ramadan* campaign, featured skills-upgrading programmes that cater to both young and old. These programmes not only encourage interaction and networking amongst the beneficiaries but it also enabled them to build up their skillsets which in turn would create new employment opportunities for them to secure a better future.

For example, one of the workshops conducted touched on financial literacy, where parents gleaned useful tips like how to manage their household budget, among others. There were also workshops organised for children and youths, equipping them with relevant communication skills that are needed to navigate their everyday surroundings. Thanks to these workshops by Yayasan MENDAKI, and supported by *Projek Positif* and *Shiok MESRA*, these beneficiaries definitely did not leave empty-handed.

The event proved to be a success, as M³ exemplifies itself as a significant source of community-building and service delivery. Together, M³ organisations leverage on each other’s strengths to uplift the community.  Dr Maliki shared that “MUIS extends its monetary support to fellow beneficiaries, while MENDAKI utilises their educational expertise to encourage childhood learning. MESRA, on the other hand, organises neighbourhood courses that enable families to learn new skills”.

This is a reflection of our *kampung spirit* and *gotong-royong!*
