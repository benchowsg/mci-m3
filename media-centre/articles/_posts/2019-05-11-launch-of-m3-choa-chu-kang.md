It was all smiles and celebrations on 11 May 2019 as the sixth M<sup>3</sup>@Town came to fruition. The launch of M<sup>3</sup>@Choa Chu Kang was held in conjunction with Choa Chu Kang GRC’s Buka Puasa 2019 event, where 1,000 Malay/Muslim residents gathered in the month of Ramadan to share food with underprivileged families.

The crowd at the event was treated to various performances and non-Muslim residents were also enlightened by the sharing on the significance of Ramadan and the Malay culture. To further strengthen the community spirit, everyone had a go to create bunga manggar, poles of colourful palm blossoms, forming a visual spectacle for all to see.

One of the key individuals at the event was none other than Chairman of M<sup>3</sup>@Choa Chu Kang, Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. When asked what he hoped would be a key take away for participants that day, he responded, “I hope what they will see is a clear collaborative effort from the Grassroots, the organisers, religious institutions and schools. They were not here just to assist us but to make sure that no single member of the community will be left behind.”

He went on to share his vision for M<sup>3</sup>@Choa Chu Kang: “We are one B.I.G. family here in Choa Chu Kang GRC: Beautiful, Inclusive and Gracious. M<sup>3</sup>@Choa Chu Kang shall embody these values in helping our young couples, families with children, vulnerable individuals and youths. We aim to strengthen the bonds of kinship and collaboration between our residents and grassroots through our existing programs and upcoming initiatives under M<sup>3</sup>@Choa Chu Kang.” 

M3@Town, is an initiative under the M3 framework, that brings more Malay/Muslim volunteers and community leaders together, tapping on their respective strengths and expertise to better serve the needs of the community.
