### **About M<sup>3</sup>**

M<sup>3</sup> is a collaborative effort between three key community institutions — Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), MENDAKI and MESRA.

It aims to build a Community of Success by:
  1. supporting citizen-centric and last-mile help for social and educational programmes, reaching families in need;
  2. serving the needs and aspirations of the Malay/Muslim community;
  3. encouraging individuals to step forward to help and promote impactful community programmes; and
  4. bringing together professionals and community leaders to contribute in local neighbourhoods, strengthening families and our next generation.

The M<sup>3</sup> logo is made up of 3 Ms joining together to form a cube. The Ms represent 3 agencies - MUIS, MENDAKI and MESRA. The 3-coloured gradients represent the collaboration between the agencies.

Together with the tagline “Maju Bersama M<sup>3</sup>”, which translates to “Progressing with M<sup>3</sup>”, the logo represents M<sup>3</sup>’s commitment to work in synergy and unity to promote a Singapore Malay/Muslim community that progresses together on a meritocracy that is inclusive and collaborative.
